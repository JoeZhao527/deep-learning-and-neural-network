# Deep Learning and Nerual Network Project
## Project 1 - Characters, Spirals and Hidden Unit Dynamics
- Part 1 (code in kuzu) is an implementation of deep nerual network to recognize handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short.
- Part 2 (code in spiral) is an experiment on training the famous Two Spirals Problem (Lang and Witbrock, 1988).
- Part 3 (code in encoder) is an experiment on hidden unit dynamics.

## Project 2 - Rating and Category Prediction
This project use pytorch to learns to read business reviews in text format and predict a rating (positive or negative) associated with each review, as well as a business category.
