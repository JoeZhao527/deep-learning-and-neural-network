## Project 1 - Characters, Spirals and Hidden Unit Dynamics
- Part 1 is an implementation of deep nerual network to recognize handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short.
- Part 2 is an experiment on training the famous Two Spirals Problem (Lang and Witbrock, 1988).
- Part 3 is an experiment on hidden unit dynamics.
